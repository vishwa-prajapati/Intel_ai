📦 Delivery Time Prediction Using Machine Learning
📖 1. Introduction
Timely and accurate delivery time estimation is crucial in supply chain management. This project develops a web-based machine learning application using Streamlit that predicts the estimated delivery time of an order based on user-inputted details such as:

Product Category

Customer Location

Shipping Method

🧠 2. Machine Learning Model Overview
📊 Dataset Used
The model was trained on a dataset containing historical order records, including:

Order details

Shipment method

Actual delivery time

⚙️ Feature Engineering
Key features such as:

Product Category

Customer Location

Shipping Method

were extracted and used to train the model.

📈 Model Selection
A regression-based machine learning model was employed to predict the expected delivery time.

📊 Performance Metrics
The model was evaluated using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

R² Score

🚀 3. Streamlit Deployment & Features
The trained machine learning model was deployed using Streamlit, providing an intuitive interface for users to input order details and receive real-time delivery time predictions.

🎨 User Interface Features
Input Fields: Users can enter order details such as:

Product Category

Customer Location

Shipping Method

Prediction Output: Displays the estimated delivery time based on the input data.

User-Friendly Interface: Ensures easy navigation and usability.

📝 4. Code & Implementation
🛠️ Key Technologies Used
Python Libraries: Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Joblib

Backend: Machine learning model trained using Scikit-learn

Deployment: Hosted on Streamlit Cloud

🔄 How It Works
User inputs order details into the Streamlit web application.

The application processes the input and passes it to the trained ML model.

The model predicts the expected delivery time.

The result is displayed in the UI.

⚡ 5. Challenges & Solutions
⚠️ Challenges Faced
Model Deployment Issues: Encountered dependency errors during deployment on Streamlit.

UI Optimization: Ensured an intuitive and interactive interface for users.
