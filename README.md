## 📊 2. Machine Learning Model Overview
### 📚 Dataset Used
The model was trained on a dataset containing historical order records, including order details, shipment method, and actual delivery time.

### 🧠 Feature Engineering
Key features such as:
- 📦 **Product category**
- 📍 **Customer location**
- 🚚 **Shipping method**  
were extracted and used to train the model.

### ⚡ Model Selection
A regression-based machine learning model was employed to predict the expected delivery time.

### 📈 Performance Metrics
The model was evaluated using:
- 📏 **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- 📉 **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- 📊 **R² Score**
